	          <p>Load the sale items available in your store that you most want to share with our users. Watch your merchandise disappear.</p>

	          <h4>Branding</h4>
	          <p>We offer verified business partners their own branded feed page. Upload your logo. Tell us a little about your store's style. Then ask some of your loyal customers to get on the site and tell others why it's great doing business with you. </p>

	          <h4>Inventory</h4>
	          <p>This part is important. When a user wants to purchase the product, we will send you an email to make sure it is still in stock. When you confirm, the sale is processed. You need to hang on to the item until the customer picks it up. If not, you will need to refund the customer.</p>

	          <h4>Account Management</h4>
	          <p>While users can sales from your store, the buy button will only be displayed if you upload the item. </p>

	          <h4>Processing</h4>
	          <p>When a customer buys the product through us, we handle the processing fee and take 20% of the sale. This part is not negotiable.</p>

	          <h4>Pickup/Delivery</h4>
	          <p>It's okay if you don't do delivery. Our customers will pick it up in store, but it's a big plus for them if you do. Just let us know if you offer delivery when you upload the product and how much you will charge for it.</p>
