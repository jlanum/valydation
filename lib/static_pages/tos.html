Referral credits are not property, have no cash value, and can only be used in connection with making a purchase on the Site. Referral credits are not transferable, assignable, or sellable, are not gift certificates, and cannot be used to purchase gift certificates. Referral credits expire 24 months after they are granted.</p>
				<p>MySaleTable reserves the right to revoke referral credits if we determine that you have engaged in fraudulent referral activity (e.g. inviting yourself to join with a fake email address, using spam to obtain referrals, or acquiring referrals through unsolicited email to persons unknown to you) or if you have otherwise violated our Terms of Use, if we terminate your membership, or if you do not comply with any of these guidelines.</p>
				    <p>Referral credits are granted at MySaleTable's sole discretion. We reserve the right to amend these guidelines and the methods through which referral credits or other benefits are earned at any time without notice to you.  For more information about the referral program, please review the full Terms and Conditions for the referral program at <a href="http://www.MySaleTable.com/help/terms-of-use/MySaleTable-referral-program-terms">www.MySaleTable.com/help/terms-of-use/MySaleTable-referral-program-terms</a>.</p>

At no time may you purchase, sell, or barter any Rewards. Rewards have no cash value. They are promotional in nature and are issued without any exchange of money or value from you. As such, Rewards do not constitute property and you do not have a vested property right or interest in the Rewards.  Rewards will expire 24 months after the date of issuance, unless otherwise stated by MySaleTable. We reserve the right at any time in our discretion, and without prior notice, to discontinue the Rewards program or to add or change Rewards program rules, terms or conditions, including changing expiration periods or Rewards values for existing or future Rewards.</p>
