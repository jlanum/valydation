			<h3>Privacy</h3>
				    <strong>MySaleTable, LLC (“MySaleTable”)</strong> values our customers and respects your privacy. We collect information about you through our website in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services and promotions. Neither your name nor anything about you is sold or shared with any other non-affiliated company or agency. However, as described in greater detail below, we may share your information under certain circumstances with business partners that help this site function or assist us in fulfilling your order. This Privacy and Usage Policy only covers information collected at this Web Site.
					<div></div>
					<div id="beta">
					<strong>Overview</strong>
					This policy describes the personal information we collect about you, why we collect it, how we use it, and when we share it with third parties. Our policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use certain information. If our information practices change, we will post an updated policy on our website. You can tell if the policy has changed by checking the revision date that appears on this policy.
					<div></div>
					<div id="beta">
					<strong>Types of Information Collected</strong>
					We sometimes ask you for certain kinds of personal information to provide the services you request. This information includes:<br>
						<li>My Account - You have the opportunity to create a personal shopping account with MySaleTable. This account allows you to shop faster and easier, and to check on order status and history. Using your name and a password of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change information. In creating this account, you authorize MySaleTable to store your name and email address. Should you elect to do so, you may also include in your “My Account” other information including shipping and billing addresses. If you choose to include such additional information then you are also authorizing MySaleTable to store such information until such time you elect to change or delete it. Each of these options is for your convenience only. The information is not used for any other purpose. If you ever use a public computer to visit the “My Account” section of our website we strongly encourage you to log out at the conclusion of your session. By doing so, although your information will still be stored with us, it will not be accessible to anyone else from that computer.</li>

						<li>Email List - When you create an account with MySaleTable, you will be given the option to be added to the MySaleTable email list. Whether or not you select this option, your personal information will never be shared with or sold to anyone. Subscriptions to the email list can be cancelled at any time. To be removed from our email list, please click the unsubscribe button found at the bottom of the emails we send you or e-mail hi@MySaleTable.com and include your name and the address in the message.</li>
						<li>Purchases - When you place an order, you will be asked to provide your credit card information.</li>
						<li>Calls to Customer Service/Participation in Promotions/Sweepstakes or Surveys - If you call our Customer Service center or participate in one of our promotions or sweepstakes or user surveys, we may ask for additional information, such as your age, interests or product preferences. Should you provide MySaleTable with any photos or other digital media, such material will be considered non-confidential, and MySaleTable has the right to publish such material on its website and related social media websites as it sees fit in accordance with the Non-Confidential Information section of this Privacy and Use Policy.</li>
					<div></div>
					<div id="beta">
					<strong>Use of Your Personal Information</strong>
					We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:
						<li>to complete your purchase transactions</li>
						<li>to provide the services you request</li>
						<li>to keep you informed about the status of your orders</li>
						<li>to identify your product and service preferences and notify you of new or additional products, services, and promotions that might be of interest</li>
						<li>to notify you of product recalls or provide other information concerning products you have purchased</li>
						<li>to improve our merchandise selections, customer service, and overall shopping experience</li>
						<li>to communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone, text message, or other means</li>
					<h4>Others with Whom We May Share Your Information</h4>
					<em>Service Providers:</em> We also may disclose information to outside companies that help us bring you the products and services we offer. For example, we may work with an outside company to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b) assist us in distributing e-mails; (c) assist us with direct marketing and data collection; (d) provide us data storage and analysis; (e) provide fraud prevention; (f) provide customer service by phone and (g) other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. We require that these outside companies agree to keep confidential all information we share with them and to use the information only to perform their obligations in the agreements.

					<em>Compliance with Law:</em> We may provide access to information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web Site, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors of this Web Site or the public.
					<h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
					While visiting our web site, you may link to sites operated by our business partners or other third parties. This does not mean that we endorse these sites. We do not make any representations or warranties about any web site you may access through the MySaleTable web site. They are independent from us, and we have no control over, or responsibility for, their information or activities.

					In addition, our privacy practices may differ from those of these other sites. If you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the MySaleTable Privacy and Usage Policy. Please make sure you understand the other site's privacy policy before providing personal information.
					<h4>Cookies</h4>
					Several of our functions use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a website that is saved on your hard drive by your computer's browser. Cookies help us remember you when you return to our website. Cookies also hold information a site may need to personalize/enhance your experience and to gather website statistical data, such as which pages are visited, what is included in your shopping cart, the Internet provider's domain name and the addresses of the sites visited immediately before coming to and immediately after leaving www.MySaleTable.com. However, none of this information is associated with you as an individual. It is measured anonymously and only in the aggregate. The information in the cookies lets MySaleTable trace your "clickstream" activity (i.e., the paths taken by visitors to our site as they move from page to page) to enable us to better serve our customers by revealing which portions of our site are the most popular. Cookies contain absolutely no personal information. You may disable cookies on your browser. Please review your browser’s instructions for doing so.
					<h4>Pixel Tags</h4>
					We also use "pixel tags" (sometimes called "web beacons" or "clear gifs"), which are tiny graphic images, on our website. Pixel tags help us analyze our customers' online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our website and our advertising. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.

					Pixel tags on our web site may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the site. This information may include your computer's Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the web site you visited immediately before coming to our site. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites.

					Pixel tags and cookies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us.

					We also work with business partners that use tracking technologies to deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to our web site and your interaction with our advertising and other communications.

					We may combine the information we collect through cookies and pixel tags with other information we have collected from you. This information may be used to improve our web site, to personalize your online experience, to help us deliver information to you, to determine the effectiveness of our advertising, and for other internal business purposes.
					<h4>Your Security</h4>
					MySaleTable goes to great lengths to keep your financial information private and safe. We take appropriate physical, electronic and administrative steps to maintain the security and accuracy of personally identifiable information we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized access. In addition, it is our policy to never send your credit card number via e-mail. Our customer service center also operate over a private, secure network. Please note, however, that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.

					We use Secure Socket Layers (SSL), the industry standard in transferring information to process your orders. The SSL encrypts, or translates, your order information into a highly indecipherable code, which is processed immediately. All credit card transactions occur in a secure area of our site, to protect you from any loss, misuse or alteration of information collected. When you have finished shopping and begin the checkout process, you will move into the secure area of our site. Once you've entered, the page address (URL) will change from http to https, to let you know you are in a secure area. Also, a key or a closed lock will appear in the lower right hand corner of your screen to notify you of this change. You will remain in this secure zone for the entire checkout process.
					Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the transmission of data over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we will use every reasonable means to ensure the security of information you transmit to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by third parties. We will, however, prosecute any unauthorized or fraudulent transactions to the fullest extent permitted by law.
					<h4>Emails</h4>
					You will receive promotional emails from us only if you have asked to receive them. If you do not want to receive e-mail from MySaleTable you may click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email communication sent by us. Please allow us 10 business days from when the request was received to complete the removal, as some of our promotions may already have been in process before you submitted your request.
					<h4>Spoofing” and “Phishing”</h4>
					A common Internet scam is known as “spoofing” or “phishing.” This occurs when you receive an email from what appears to be a legitimate source requesting personal information from you. Please be aware that MySaleTable will NEVER send you an email requesting you to verify credit card, bank information, or any other personal information. If you ever receive an email that appears to be from us requesting such information from you, DO NOT respond to it, and DO NOT click on any links appearing in the email. Instead, please immediately forward the email to us at hi@MySaleTable, as we will investigate all instances of possible Internet fraud and contact the appropriate authorities.
					<h4>Children</h4>
					Our web site is not meant for children, and we will not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 without verified parental consent. We will remove from our files any personally identifiable information of anyone we discover to be under 13 years old. Our online contests or sweepstakes are restricted to entrants who are at least 18 years old.
					<h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4>
					Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice describing what categories of personal customer information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of information shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names and addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: MySaleTable LLC, 3450 Sacramento Street, PMB 231 San Francisco, CA 94118 , Attn: Customer Service or by email to hi@MySaleTable.com. Please allow 30 days for a response.
